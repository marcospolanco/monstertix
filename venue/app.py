"""The venue — a fake ticket seller that misbehaves on command.

WHAT THIS IS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

One file. A pretend Ticketmaster the agent can search, queue for, and buy from —
plus a control panel of buttons that make it fail in specific, useful ways.

It is deliberately not production-shaped. Everything a reader needs to follow
one request is in this file, in the order the request travels.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    MODULE 1  request log stays flat at 10am — nothing to do here, that's
             the point. Nobody calls the agent.
    MODULE 3  seatmap() returns captured_at, so students can see a snapshot age
    MOD 4    join_queue() returns instantly — the agent parks on it
    MODULE 4  sell_out() makes the snapshot a lie
             hang_once() commits an order and then fails the response
             Idempotency-Key is OPTIONAL, so the retry can buy twice
    MODULE 6  drop_presale() fires the same message Cloud Scheduler sends at 3am
