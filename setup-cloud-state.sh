#     ./setup-cloud-state.sh
#
# Everything the agent remembers has been on your laptop until now:
#
#     sessions.db          a SQLite file next to the code
#     memory/*.md          a markdown file you can open in an editor
#     artifacts/           seat maps written to a folder
#
# All three are perfect for learning and all three are wrong in the cloud, for
# the same reason: a Cloud Run container has a writable filesystem that is
# destroyed when the instance goes away, which happens whenever traffic stops.
# Write a session to /tmp at 3am and it is gone by morning — no error, no
# warning, just an agent that has forgotten it was ever in a queue.
#
# So this script makes three things that outlive a container:
#
#     1. a database on the Cloud SQL instance setup.sh started for you
#     2. a user for the agent to connect as
#     3. a Cloud Storage bucket for memory and artifacts
#
# and prints the two URIs that replace the two file paths.
