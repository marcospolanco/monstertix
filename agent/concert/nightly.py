"""MODULE 5 — the graph, now inside the same budget.

Nothing here replaces what you built. It surrounds it.

    START ─► open ─► pick_show ──► queue_up ──► check_front ──► buy_it
             (fn)     (agent)       (function)    (function)      (agent)
             reads memory  joins once,   at the front?   buys, using
             picks a show  keeps ticket    no → PAUSE    the seat map
                                           yes ↓          it re-reads
             ─ runs once ─────────────┘    │
                                           └─ every wake-up re-checks

The shape of that graph is the whole lesson, and it is not "replace the agent
with a script". Two nodes are agents, because choosing a show and reacting to a
seat map that moved are judgement. Two nodes are functions, because joining a
queue and asking "am I at the front yet" are rules, and a rule should not be a
coin flip at 3am.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT IS NOT AT THE FRONT

`check_front` returns a `RequestInput`. That is ADK's interrupt: the graph stops
where it stands and the invocation is written to the session store. Nothing
loops, nothing sleeps, nothing holds a connection open. The process can die.

Waking it up runs `check_front` again — and only `check_front`:

    @node(rerun_on_resume=False)     pick_show, queue_up
        already done. Resuming does not redo them, so the agent does not pick a
        second show and you do not take a second queue ticket.

    @node(rerun_on_resume=True)      check_front
        the whole point. Every wake-up asks the venue where you are, and either
        stops again or falls through to the purchase.

So the run ends in exactly one place: tickets bought. It just might take all
night and several wake-ups to get there, and it costs nothing in between.

Run it by hand:
    python -m concert.nightly

It will stop at #14,203. Press SKIP THE WAIT on the panel, and it wakes itself
to show you the loop. In Module 6 the thing doing the waking is Cloud Scheduler.

Choose one show and one section to buy.

THERE IS NOBODY THERE. It is 3am and the person is asleep. You cannot ask a
question, because nothing will answer it and the run will simply stop. Never end
your turn with a question. Never offer to do something and wait for a yes — just
do it. Work through the tools until you have a plan, then return the plan.

Call recall() first. It holds what previous bookings taught you about this
person — who they go with, what they cannot stand, what they are willing to
spend. Those preferences are the whole basis for the choice.

Then search_events. Then get_seatmap for the show you settled on — do not ask
whether to look at it, just look.

The budget is in the message you were sent, written the way the person said it.
Apply all of it — the prices, and any conditions about which sections or days.

The largest amount they named anywhere in that sentence is a HARD CEILING. Check
each section's price against it before you choose: if the price is higher than
that number, that section is not an option, no matter how well it fits the rest
of what they said. "$200 if they're the good ones" means a $210 seat is out.

How many seats to buy is in that same message, in their words. "I have 10 people
coming with me" is eleven seats, not ten and not two. If they never say, buy two.
Whatever number you settle on, put it in `seats`, and the section must have that
many available right now. If nothing is both available and under the ceiling,
choose nothing.

The city and the days are in there too. A person who says they live in New York
and can only do weekends has ruled out every weekday show and every other city,
even when a cheaper seat exists somewhere they cannot go.

Return the plan. Put the reason in one sentence, in terms of what you know about
this person — not "section A is the best seats".
