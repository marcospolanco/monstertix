"""MODULE 4 tools — the agent learns to wait.

join_queue is the one that matters. It returns *immediately* with a pending
status and a ticket, and the invocation parks. The agent is not running during
the forty minutes that follow. It is gone. Something external brings it back.

Nothing is looping and nothing holds a connection open. When somebody asks the
agent again — you, or a scheduler — it picks up where it stopped, because the
session was written to disk before it parked.
